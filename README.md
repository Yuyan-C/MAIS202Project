# Forest Cover Type Predictor
Final project for McGill AI Society Accelerated Intro to ML Course (Winter 2021)

Training data retrived from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/forest-cover-type-dataset">Forest Cover Type Dataset</a>

## Project Description
This forest cover type predictor is a web app that predicts what types of trees grow in a region based on the surrounding characteristics. The prediction model is built with sklearn and the web app is built with flask. I reuse part of the codes from <a href="https://github.com/McGillAISociety/Fall2020-Workshop3">MAIS webapp workshop</a>

## Usage
To run the web app, install all packages in requirement.txt. 

Download the backend directory and run app.py. 

Open a browser and navigate to your http://localhost:5000.
